# Project Get Excited People
---------------------------------
## We are deployed on heroku

https://get-excited-people.herokuapp.com/

---------------------------------
## Web Application

The app we built is a textbot called Get Excited People and it will allow users to create their own library of inspiring quotes, songs, videoes or pictures. And then the textbot will automatically picked a random content from their library and send it to the user once a day.

Users have access to read, create, update, and delete the contents from their own library by sending commands at the inspirations channel in Slack me. The app checks the user id to make sure they only have access to their own database.
